# GameMover2000
A utility to easily create system directory links between two locations.

I mainly use it to transfer games between my SSD and Raid0 volume.

The program needs to be run in elevated mode (as administrator) in order to create sytemlinks. When debuging make sure to start Visual Studio as administrator.

I haven't encoutered any bugs while using the program for my own purposes however im sure there's undiscovered "features". Because of this the program is offered as it is and I can not take resposibility for any damge it could cause.
